## Thermal Image Human Action Recongition (TIHAR)


### Introduction

Thermal imaging is the process of converting infrared (IR) radiation (heat) into visible images that depict the spatial distribution of temperature differences in a scene viewed by a thermal camera. It is useful in allowing for object distinction without the aid of an illumination source. Thermal imaging is ideal for producing images at night or in the presence of some obscuration, such as light fog, rain, or smoke.

In this project, we investigate the feasibility of using thermal images (through videos) and deep learning techniques to see how it can be used to detect a human object and recognise the human activity that the human object is performing.  We scoped our work to classify three distinct activities - Concentrating, Relaxing, and Exercising.
